# z_goop
**z_goop** is a low level windowing and rendering (and later audio if this gets continued) interface designed mainly for game developers.  
It stands for:
- z - zig
- g - ... literally nothing. this doesent stand for anything. this may be interpreted as "game" though.
- oop - object oriented programming (this was originally going to be the case)

It has a few builtin backends (glfw, opengl), but the user can choose to use a backend other than the ones provided (or make their own).  

## graah
This repo does also come with **graah**, which stands for "(z)goop-rendering-abstraction-ah".  
It was designed as a way to make game programming easier by providing simple functions to draw simple shapes. It can also be used alongside z_goop.
